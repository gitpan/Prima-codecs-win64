Image codecs for win64
----------------------

Prima needs image libraries to work correctly. Unix and cygwin builds rely on
existing installations of libjpeg, libungif, libtiff, libpng, and libXpm,
all of them being optional dependencies.

This binary distribution provides the libraries above and their include files,
for MSVC build.

Installation
-------------------

perl Makefile.PL
make install
